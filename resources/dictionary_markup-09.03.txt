<text> An if-statement consists of three aspects: one conditional statement and two blocks of code.  In this version, the conditional statement is formed using two dropdowns and a text box.  First, select the turtle attribute you want to test from the first dropdown, such as "heading."  Next, select a relational operator from the dropdown such as "less than." Finally enter a numeric value into the text field- 34, for example.  If the condition is true (the turtle's heading is less than 34) then the first block of code will execute.  If the condition is false, then the second block of code will execute.
