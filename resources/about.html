<h3>What is ViMAP?</h3>
<p>ViMAP is a new multi-agent based, visual programming language for middle school children to support science learning through scientific modeling and computational thinking. ViMAP programming primitives are designed to support domain-specific modeling, as well as domain-general supports for computational thinking.</p>
<p>ViMAP leverages student&apos;s intuitive knowledge in multiple forms: embodied actions, aesthetic understanding, and intuitive knowledge of the physical and biological world. The programming commands are designed to integrate complex forms of computational thinking with a narrative-style, drag-and-drop interface that is easy to understand for children. At the same time, ViMAP emphasizes scientific modeling practices such as measurement and graphing through the use of software scaffolds that are specifically designed to support domain-specific modeling.</p>


<h3>Impact / Benefits</h3>
<p>Computational modeling and programming play integral roles in scientific and engineering research. However, integrating these practices in science classrooms have been shown to challenging. ViMAP is designed specifically to address these challenges. Ongoing studies in a high poverty, 98% African American middle school in Tennessee reveals that 5th grade students are able to show significant learning gains in both computational thinking and scientific modeling using ViMAP. ViMAP-based science curricular units has the potential to replace traditional science classroom instruction with a more generative, computation based science curriculum that can also begin to prepare students for a 21st century, computation-intensive workforce.</p>
