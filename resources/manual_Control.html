        An if-statement consists of three aspects: one conditional statement and two blocks of code.  Drag any commands you wish into the two blocks.  In this version, the conditional statement is selected with the drop-down.  If the selected condition is true, then only block one will execute.  If the selected condition is false, then only block two (the otherwise block) will execute.   
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="if-comp-int">if statement version #2</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/if-comp-int.png" />
    <br />
         An if-statement consists of three aspects: one conditional statement and two blocks of code.  In this version, the conditional statement is formed using two dropdowns and a text box.  First, select the turtle attribute you want to test from the first dropdown, such as "heading."  Next, select a relational operator from the dropdown such as "less than." Finally enter a numeric value into the text field- 34, for example.  If the condition is true (the turtle's heading is less than 34) then the first block of code will execute.  If the condition is false, then the second block of code will execute.  
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="Repeat">repeat block</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/Repeat.png" />
    <br />
        Repeats all the command blocks inside the repeat block. Enter the <b><i>number</i></b> of times you want the commands to execute in the field.
