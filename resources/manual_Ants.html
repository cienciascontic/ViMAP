    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="face-chemical">face chemical</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/face-chemical.png" />
    <br />
        Points the turtle in the direction of the closest chemical.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="face-nest">face nest</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/face-nest.png" />
    <br />
        Points the ant in the direction of the nest.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="i-don&apos;t-have-food">i don&apos;t have food</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/i-don&apos;t-have-food.png" />
    <br />
        Tells the ant that it does not have any food. If the ant is asked later in the program it will report that it has no food.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="i-have-food">i have food</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/i-have-food.png" />
    <br />
        Tells the ant that it currently has food. If the ant is asked later in the program it will report that it has food.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="place-chemical">place chemical</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/place-chemical.png " />
    <br />
        Similar to the <a href="#stamp"><img src = "../blockImages/stamp.png" class = "intext" /></a> command, but instead of putting down an imprint of itself, the ant places some invisible chemical in the world at its current location. The chemical can be detected by other ants. 
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="remove-food-here">remove food here</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/remove-food-here.png " />
    <br />
        Ant will try to pick up food. If it is standing on top of food <a href="#i-have-food"><img src = "../blockImages/i-have-food.png" class = "intext" /></a> will be true.  <!-- Unknown -->
