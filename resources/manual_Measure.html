    <p><img src = "../blockImages/clear-measure-points.png" />
    <br />
        Removes all measure points that have been placed in the world by <a href="#place-measure-point"><img src = "../blockImages/place-measure-point.png" class = "intext" /></a>.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="place-measure-point">place measure point</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/place-measure-point.png" />
    <br />
        Places a flag in the world where the turtle currently is located.  The measure point also stores information about the turtle at that point that can be shown in the graphs. <br/> The measure points are read by the graphing tools in ViMAP. This command can be undone by <a href="#clear-measure-points"><img src = "../blockImages/clear-measure-points.png" class = "intext" /></a>. 
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="set-label">set label </a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/set-label.png" />
    <br />
        Choose from the dropdown menu which attribute the turtle displays as a label. Now next to the turtle, a small, black, numeric label is visible and it displays the current value.  
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="start-measuring">start measuring</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/start-measuring.png" />
    <br />
        The turtle resets all its measurements to zero.  All previously placed measure flags are not removed and will display their proper values.  Each time the turtle receives the <a href="#start-measuring"><img src = "../blockImages/start-measuring.png" class = "intext" /></a> command, it starts to measure again from scratch.   <!-- Pen -->
