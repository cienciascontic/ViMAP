    <p><img src = "../blockImages/set-heading.png" />
    <br />
        Enter a number in the field. The turtle or turtles will set their direction of travel to that polar coordinate. In ViMAP, a heading of 0 makes the turtle point in the direction of the top-center of the world, 90 is to the right, 180 is toward the bottom-center of the world, and 270 is to the left.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="set-heading-to-secret-number">set heading to secret number</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/set-heading-to-secret-number.png" />
    <br />
        The turtle chooses a random number between 0 and 360 and then sets its heading to that number.

    <p><img src = "../blockImages/start-measuring.png" />
    <br />
        The turtle resets all its measurements to zero.  All previously placed measure flags are not removed and will display their proper values.  Each time the turtle receives the <a href="#start-measuring"><img src = "../blockImages/start-measuring.png" class = "intext" /></a> command, it starts to measure again from scratch.   <!-- Pen -->

All other turtles will not be in the group. <!-- Measure -->

        Asks the turtle to set its x-coordinate equal to the original x-coordinate, minus the reading of sensor 1 or sensor 2.  To find out the coordinates for any point in the enactment world, secondary click (or right click) to get a report of the x and y coordinates for that position.
