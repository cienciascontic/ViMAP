    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="face">face</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/face.png" />
    <br />
        The turtle, or turtles in the group, will change their heading to face (or point towards) the xy coordinates. Enter the x-coordinate in the first field and the y-coordinate in the second field. 
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="go-backward">go backward</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/go-backward.png" />
    <br />
        Moves the turtle in the direction that is opposite the direction that it is pointing, but does not change the heading. <br/> You must set the <b><i>step-size</i></b> with <a href="#set-step-size"><img src = "../blockImages/set-step-size.png" class = "intext" /></a> or the turtle will not move.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="go-forward">go forward</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/go-forward.png" />
    <br />
        Turtles in the group will move in the direction of their heading. You must set the step-size with <a href="#set-step-size"><img src = "../blockImages/set-step-size.png" class = "intext" /></a> or the turtle will not move.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="left">left turn</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/left.png" />
    <br />
         Turns the turtle or turtles left by the <b><i>number</i></b> of degrees you put in the field. For example, if the heading is 100 and you turn left 60, the new heading will be 40. It is the opposite command to <a href="#right"><img src = "../blockImages/right.png" class = "intext" /></a> <!-- Movement -->
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="random-turn">random turn </a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/random-turn.png" />
    <br />
        First, the turtle chooses a random number between 1 and <b><i>number</i></b>. Next the turtle turns either right or left from where it is pointed by that number of degrees.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="reset-forward-values">reset forward values</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/reset-forward-values.png" />
    <br />
        Resets the step-size of the turtle, or, of all turtles in the group, to zero.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="right">right turn </a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/right.png" />
    <br />
        Turns the turtle or turtles right by the <b><i>number</i></b> of degrees you put in the field. For example, if the heading is 100 and you turn right 60, the new heading will be 160. It is the opposite command to <a href="#left"><img src = "../blockImages/left.png" class = "intext" /></a>
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="set-heading">set heading </a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/set-heading.png" />
    <br />
        Enter a number in the field. The turtle or turtles will set their direction of travel to that polar coordinate. In ViMAP, a heading of 0 makes the turtle point in the direction of the top-center of the world, 90 is to the right, 180 is toward the bottom-center of the world, and 270 is to the left.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="set-random-heading">set random heading</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/set-random-heading.png" />
    <br />
        Set the turtle&apos;s <b><i>heading</i></b>, to a <b><i>random</i></b> number.<br /> Enter any two angles to set the limits.  The random angle will be greater than or equal to <b><i>field1</i></b> but less than or equal to <b><i>field2</i></b>.  <!-- Secret Number -->
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="set-step-size">set step-size </a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/set-step-size.png" />
    <br />
         Sets the step-size of the turtle or turtles to the <b><i>number</i></b> you put in the field. For example, a step-size of 50 is five times as large as a step-size of 10. This command is always used with a <a href="#go-forward"><img src = "../blockImages/go-forward.png" class = "intext" /></a>
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="set-step_size-minus">set step-size minus</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/set-step_size-minus.png" />
    <br />
        Set step-size for the turtle, equal to the current step-size minus a number you enter. For example, if the step-size was 10, and you <b><i>set step-size minus 2 </i></b>, the updated step-size will be 8. Does not allow step-sizes less than 0.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="set-step_size-plus">set step-size plus</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/set-step_size-plus.png" />
    <br />
        Set step-size for the turtle, equal to the current step-size plus a number you enter. For example, if the step-size was 10, and you <b><i>set step-size plus 2</i></b>, the updated step-size will be 12.
    </p>

    <h3 class = "speech"><a id="set-xy">set xy</a></h3>
    <p><img src = "../blockImages/set-xy.png" />
    <br />
        Sets the position of the turtle or turtles to the x and y coordinates you specify. To find out the coordinates for any point in the enactment world, secondary click (or right click) to get a report of the x and y coordinates for that position. Enter the x-coordinate in the first field, and the y-coordinate in the second.  <!-- Groups -->
